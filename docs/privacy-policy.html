    <h1>BusWatch Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        BusWatch is a Wear OS application that shows real-time London bus arrivals.
        Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data we access and how we use it.
    </p>

    <h2>Data We Access</h2>
    <h3>Location Data</h3>
    <p>
        BusWatch requests access to your device's location to find bus stops near you.
        This location data is:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Used locally only</strong> - Your location is sent directly to the Transport for London (TfL) API to find nearby stops</li>
        <li><strong>Not stored</strong> - We do not store your location history</li>
        <li><strong>Not shared</strong> - Your location is not shared with any third parties other than TfL's public API</li>
        <li><strong>Not transmitted to our servers</strong> - BusWatch has no backend servers; all data flows directly between your device and TfL</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Network Data</h3>
    <p>
        The app connects to the TfL Unified API to retrieve:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bus stop information (names, locations, routes)</li>
        <li>Real-time arrival predictions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data We Store</h2>
    <p>
        BusWatch stores minimal data on your device only:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Last selected stop</strong> - To quickly show your preferred stop when you open the app</li>
        <li><strong>Preferences</strong> - Any app settings you configure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This data is stored locally on your watch and is not transmitted anywhere.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <h3>Transport for London (TfL) API</h3>
    <p>
        BusWatch uses the <a href="https://api.tfl.gov.uk/">TfL Unified API</a> to retrieve bus information.
        When you use BusWatch, your approximate location is sent to TfL to find nearby stops.
        TfL's privacy policy applies to their processing of this data:
        <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/privacy-and-cookies/">TfL Privacy Policy</a>
    </p>

    <h3>Google Play Services</h3>
    <p>
        BusWatch uses Google Play Services for location functionality.
        Google's privacy policy applies: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        BusWatch does not knowingly collect any personal information from children.
        The app simply displays public transport information.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page
        with an updated revision date.
    </p>
