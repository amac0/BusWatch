BusWatch brings real-time London bus arrival information to your Wear OS smartwatch.

FEATURES

- Nearby stops: Automatically finds the 5 closest bus stops based on your location
- Live arrivals: See real-time arrival predictions powered by Transport for London
- All routes: View every bus route serving each stop
- Quick access: Remembers your last selected stop for fast access
- Auto-refresh: Updates stop list when you move to a new area

HOW IT WORKS

1. Open BusWatch on your watch
2. Grant location permission when prompted
3. Select a bus stop from the list
4. View live arrival times for all buses

The app uses your location to find bus stops within 1km of your position. Arrival times are color-coded so you can see at a glance which buses are arriving soon.

DATA SOURCE

All bus information is provided by the Transport for London (TfL) Unified API, ensuring you get the same accurate data as official TfL services.

PRIVACY

BusWatch respects your privacy. Your location is only used to find nearby stops and is never stored or shared. The app has no backend servers - data flows directly between your watch and TfL.

REQUIREMENTS

- Wear OS 3.0 or later
- Location services enabled
- Internet connection
